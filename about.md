My name is Benjamin and I work as a security consultant at [Assured](https://www.assured.se). I'm mostly invovled in network- and infrastructure security projects but lately also in automotive security projects. I'm running the two-days, single-track security conference [Security Fest](https://www.securityfest.com) in Gothenburg, Sweden (where I live). Sometimes I like to fiddle a bit with electronics and made my first conference badge for Security fest 2019. 

This blog is mainly notes I'm trying to blogify and share. I will probably write posts about IT security and electronics. Hopefully I update every month or so. 

Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bewniac) or check out my horrific code at [github](https://github.com/bewniac).
