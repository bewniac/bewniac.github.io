My name is Benjamin and I work as a security consultant at [Assured](https://www.assured.se) with a focus on network and infrastructure security. I also work with automotive security and is at times giving workshop in the subject with a in-house developed car hacking platform called "CyCar". I fiddle a bit with electronics and made the 2019 badge for [Security Fest](https://www.securityfest.com) which I'm an organizer of. 

This blog is mainly notes I'm trying to blogify and share. Hopefully I will do something with this.
